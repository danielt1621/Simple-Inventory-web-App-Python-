** IT Inventory web applciation v1. Daniel Tsavalos




General ideas and notes:

- The inventory_data.json file, contains all the data that will then be fetched by the application

- Server.py start a local server at http://locahost:5000

- To change the low items threshold the user should edit the index.html file

- The string to laod the application is in the login.php file

- The flask server should be on inroder to access the web site
